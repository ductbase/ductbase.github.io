# What is DUCTbase
DUCTbase is an eco system that consists of DUCTdb, a shared-ledger database deisgned for the mobile world. 

# The Justification
Business applications on mobile devices and apps in general do not take advantage of the close to a terrabyte of storage and the power of the multi-threaded device that most of us carry in our pockets now. 

Architects continue to design database architectures from the days of client-server computing. Where the business rules are still implemented on the back-end server. Supporting petabytes of storage on backend servers is becoming the norm. 

DUCTdb is a shared ledger database that is simple. Its purpose is to deliver Delete, Update and Change transaction to devices in order. 

The databse is designed to be implemented on Mac OSX only and is written completely in Swift using the latest Apple Network Framework. Now that we have Mac OSX servers, virtualization on Macs cannot be very far away.
